"""
In a country there are three types of coin: the first has value a,
the second has value b, and the thirs has value c. In the country,
a price w can be paid exactly if and only if there exist three non-negative
integers i_a, i_b, and i_c such that w = i_a * a + i_b * b + i_c * c
â€”that is, such that w equals the total value of i_a coins of value a,
i_b coins of value b, and i_c coins of value c. The following is an
algorithm that, given a, b, c, and a price w, returns True if w can be
paid exactly, and False otherwise.
